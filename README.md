A custom launcher for terraria coded in python, this is a work in progress.

### Future features
- Stable data backup implementation
- Terraria instance management
- Support for all versions between 1.0.0 - 1.4.2.3
- Automatic Terraria install and save location detection
- Version downloads hosted on archive.org rather than a local server

### Known issues
- Server previously used for downloading versions is down
- No indication of client download progress
- Instance data handling isn't very secure/efficient

### Important info
Versions will be downloaded from <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, meaning download speeds could be slow.
You will need to configure your Terraria save location and Terraria install location correctly because the data could be deleted or overwritten.
Steam will need to be installed and signed into an account that has a purchased copy of the game for it to launch correctly.
